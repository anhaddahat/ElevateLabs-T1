#IP addresses found ranging between: 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.63
#Open ports found: 53,80,443,554,5000,7000,8008,8009,9000

#services running in these ports:
-Port 80 (HTTP): This is the standard port for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), used for unencrypted web traffic. This means a web server is likely running.

-Port 443 (HTTPS): This is the standard port for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), used for encrypted web traffic. This also indicates a web server, but with SSL/TLS encryption.

-Port 53 (DNS): This is the standard port for Domain Name System (DNS). A DNS server is likely running, which translates domain names into IP addresses.

-Port 554 (RTSP): This port is commonly used by Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP). This suggests a media streaming server (e.g., for CCTV, video conferencing, or other real-time media).

-Port 5000: UPnP (Universal Plug and Play): Used for automatic discovery and configuration of network devices.

#potential security risks from open ports:
1. Increased Attack Surface: Every open port is a potential entry point for attackers. The more open ports, the larger the attack surface.

2. Vulnerability Exploitation: If the running service has known vulnerabilities (e.g., unpatched software, misconfigurations), attackers can exploit them to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code, or cause denial of service.

3. Information Gathering/Fingerprinting: Attackers can use open ports to identify the type and version of the running service, which helps them tailor specific attacks.

4.Brute-Force Attacks: Services requiring authentication (e.g., web server admin panels, database logins) can be subjected to brute-force attacks to guess credentials.

5.Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) Attacks: Attackers can flood open ports with traffic to overwhelm the service and make it unavailable to legitimate users.
